# Mission-to-Mars Analysis

## Purpose
- During this project, I practiced using skills to scrape data from a website by understanding the HTML from that site. 
- I stored the scraped data in a Mongo database.
- Mongo databases are an efficient way of storing scraped data because there does not need to be a certain structure to them. 
- After storing the data, I displayed the data on a web application. 
- The next part of the assignment was to alter the design of the web app using Bootstrap 3 components. 

## Results

Below is a snippet from the web app, where it shows the "Scrape New Data" button where a user can click that button to retrieve the most updated information such as articles and images.
